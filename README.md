# ProgrammingSetup
A place to define how programmers need to get setup to be effective

* Start with the [Welcome to team 5607 Programmer's Guide
](https://github.com/FirewallRobotics/ProgrammingSetup/blob/main/docs/index.md#welcome-to-team-5607-programmers-guide)
* For Robot in a weekend you will want to jump [here
](https://github.com/FirewallRobotics/ProgrammingSetup/blob/main/docs/index.md#robot-in-a-weekend--riaw) in the Guide.
* [Vision Reference page](https://github.com/FirewallRobotics/ProgrammingSetup/blob/main/docs/visionrefernces.md)

# Want to pick up a new language or do self-study?
* Mrs. Darby recommends checking out [Hackerrank.com for developers
](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) they have practical tutorials for Java, C++, Python, Javascrpt... prep sections for interviews (for later), and sections on fun topics like Machine learning and AI. They score your activity and completed exercises. You can add your profile link to a resume to show that you are an active and capable programmer. ;) Signup for a daily exercise topic that intrigues you. Much of the content is free.
* Check out [Google Summer of code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) for students and get involved with Opensource projects. 

# Helpful tips for building this docs repository for the Firewall Programming team
use the github "raw" button to see how to format headers and link in content or new pages

# This is a header, denoted by the hashmark
## Multiple hashmarks are used to create subheaders
* this is a bullet list
* use the astrisk in front of the lines of you list

  this is how you format and add links [text](url) Here is a working example[Getting started with Apriltags](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/11/02/apriltag-with-python/)

  To add a new topic file to the docs repository just add the file under docs using the '+' in the left pane near "main" and name the file. Add your content and commit. Go to the readme.md or index.md and create a link to your new page.
  Example, I created visonrefrernce.md. I'm linking it here [New Vision Reference page](https://github.com/FirewallRobotics/ProgrammingSetup/blob/main/docs/visionrefernces.md)
