# How to connect to pi with ethernet for the first time
* original ip address for pi is 169.254.133.215. bring up web browser http://169.2254.144.215

# How to update or install packages to the pi using the web 
## Example April tags
First, download the package on another computer using

pip download apriltag

This will create a file apriltag-0.0.16.tar.gz in whatever directory you run it in. Upload that to the pi using the web interface (Application/File Upload, donâ€™t extract it) and finally ssh into the pi and run:

pip3 install apriltag --no-index --find-links ./
* Make sure you turn off the "Extract .zip or tgx" slide button.
